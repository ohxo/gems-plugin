# gems-plugin
A tiny currency plugin for Minecraft Server

Works best in 1.20+ versions

I don't advise compiling it, it's an intellij project, use the src to find out how it's made only

This was thought for my old Minecraft server ChaosMC, and was meant to be a used as a daily reward currency, to then buy things in a specific menu shop
There's a placeholder too: %playergemme%

Feel free to ask anything if you're curious :)
